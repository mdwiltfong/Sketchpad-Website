## Introduction

This project started as a paperless solution to writing out math problems and taking math notes, as well as an exploration of the canvas API. It was going to be designed as a simple notepad  though when I began having inssues with the notepad background I began to pivot away from that idea and end designed the features around a ms paint like app.

## Development 

Using other painting apps as a guide for features the goal was to mimic those features using vanilla javascript. The features I was most interested in was being able to pick colors from off the canvas, adding a saturation and light slider, and being able to show which color is currently selected. As its features grew so did the desire to continue to build and add to them. When others were testing the app they raised questions about the UI which also helped in determining development.


## Outcome

It its current form you can freehand draw with a mouse or stylus, change line weight, chose from a variety of colors, and save your creation. I'm proud of where it is at but will likely add features in the future. Any future development will focus on balancing feature variety with simplicity of use.

I learned the importance of designing a user experience. Users have to have a satisfying experience when interacting with a webpage. Every click, scroll, feature placement, etc.. has to contribute to that.
